description: >
  This hypothesis reconstructs the entire analytic and probabilistic Dirichlet framework—
  including prime distribution, equidistribution, and Dirichlet processes—
  using a symmetry-free, internally generated spectral system based on axioms H1′–H5′.
  It eliminates modular partitions, characters, and sigma-algebras,
  providing a fully constructive and formally compatible foundation for symbolic and mathematical reasoning.
