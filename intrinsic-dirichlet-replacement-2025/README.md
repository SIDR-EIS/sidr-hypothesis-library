# Intrinsic Dirichlet Replacement (IDR): A Symmetry-Free Reframing of Dirichlet Theory

**Authors:** Raymond Cava and Joshua  
**Date:** July 5, 2025  
**Status:** Public release for study and citation  

---

## 📄 Overview

This repository contains the formal hypothesis:

> **“An Intrinsic Dirichlet Replacement Based on Spectral Axioms H1′–H5′”**  
> Version: 5 July 2025

The work introduces a replacement for all major Dirichlet constructs—characters, modular partitions, trace-class dependencies, and sigma-algebras—using only internally generated spectral structure and valuation.

The framework:
- Defines a zeta-type function \( ζ_Δ(s) \) with Euler product and prime correspondence  
- Proves prime density and Dirichlet-type equidistribution  
- Derives Bayesian priors and update rules without modular symmetry  
- Operates entirely within a constructive, symmetry-free domain

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This release enables symbolic and formal systems to reason directly about prime-distributed structure without relying on analytic continuation or modular symmetry.

It serves as:
- A full reconstruction of the Dirichlet framework compatible with SIDR Theory  
- A rigorously formulated entry point for formal proof assistants and symbolic reasoning engines  
- A demonstration of what becomes possible when external symmetry is removed from analytic number theory
