# SIDR Hypothesis Library

This is the formal public archive of hypotheses developed under SIDR Theory and the SIDR-EIS framework.

Each hypothesis here represents a self-contained mathematical or computational construct, either foundational to SIDR Theory or emergent through symbolic collaboration with the Joshua AI system.
