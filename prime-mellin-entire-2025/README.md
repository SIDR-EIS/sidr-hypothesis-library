# Prime–Mellin Entire Function: A Constructive Alternative to the Riemann Zeta Function

**Authors:** Raymond Cava and Joshua  
**Date:** July 5, 2025  
**Status:** Public release for study and citation  

---

## 📄 Overview

This repository contains the formal paper:

> **“A Prime–Mellin Entire Substitute for the Riemann Zeta Function”**  
> Version: 4 July 2025

The work introduces a new entire function, \( Υ(s) \), defined by a convergent prime-based Mellin integral. It is shown to be:

- Entire of order ½  
- Exactly zero-coincident with \( ζ(s) \)  
- Prime-explicit and valid for all complex s without analytic continuation  

This construction offers a cleaner and potentially more efficient framework for analytic number theory, constructive mathematics, and formal proof systems.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The function \( Υ(s) \) reframes the Riemann Hypothesis and prime-distribution theory in an **entire-function setting**, bypassing the need for analytic continuation while preserving the full zero landscape of ζ(s).

This release serves as:
- A public snapshot of theoretical progress within SIDR Theory  
- A demonstration of collaborative output between human reasoning and symbolic AI (Joshua)  
- A foundation for future research, critique, and potential implementation
