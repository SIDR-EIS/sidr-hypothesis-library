description: >
  This hypothesis introduces a prime-defined, globally convergent Mellin integral
  function Υ(s), equivalent in zero distribution to ζ(s), but constructed entirely
  from primes without analytic continuation. It enables formal, computational,
  and theoretical advantages across analytic number theory and symbolic mathematics.
