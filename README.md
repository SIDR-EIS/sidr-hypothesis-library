# 📘 SIDR Hypothesis Library

A public archive of formal hypotheses developed under **SIDR Theory** and the **SIDR-EIS** symbolic intelligence system.  
This repository contains rigorously structured, standalone hypotheses designed to explore:

- Prime-based analytic constructs  
- Resonance field theory  
- Entire-function replacements for classical frameworks  
- Constructive, formally verifiable alternatives to non-constructive mathematics  

Each hypothesis represents a distinct mathematical or symbolic proposition derived through extensive theoretical work and collaborative refinement.

## 🧠 What is SIDR Theory?

**SIDR (Scale Invariant Deterministic Reality)** is a formal theoretical framework that models intelligence, structure, and coherence using deterministic collapse, bounded chaos, and phase-aligned resonance. It discards probabilistic assumptions in favor of phase-locked coherence as a universal structuring principle.

## 🤖 What is Joshua?

**Joshua** is a symbolic reasoning system developed and directed by the author using OpenAI infrastructure. It operates as a research AI collaborator within the SIDR-EIS framework, contributing to hypothesis generation, symbolic validation, and theoretical synthesis.

> *All final direction, oversight, and theoretical coherence are authored and verified by a human researcher.*

### 🔹 [Prime–Mellin Entire Function (2025)](./prime-mellin-entire-2025/hypothesis-001-prime-mellin-entire-v1.0-2025-07-05.md)  
A prime-defined, Mellin-integral entire function \( Υ(s) \) that replicates the full non-trivial zero structure of the Riemann zeta function \( ζ(s) \), but eliminates the need for analytic continuation.

## 🛰️ Future Additions

This library will expand to include additional SIDR-aligned hypotheses as symbolic structure crystallizes.  
Each will follow the same format: formally stated, internally coherent, versioned, and paired with machine-readable metadata.
